# vladh's dotfiles

My dotfiles include configs for **vim**, **tmux** and **bash**. They are good for setting up Mac OS X as a development system, but work on Linux too. Here's a (non-exhaustive) list of features:

* Consistent color scheme across bash, vim etc. (custom Monokai, with alternate themes if you want them)
* Sane vim config with modern, sensible settings
* Syntax checking right inside vim with [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic)
* Fuzzy finding in vim with [ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)
* Bash prompt with git branch and time since last commit (thanks to [grb](https://github.com/garybernhardt))
* Powerline in vim and tmux
* vim support for lots of web-related things (PHP, Mustache, CoffeeScript, HAML, Jade, Markdown, Mocha, rspec, Stylusâ€¦)
* Hacks to make everything work properly in Mac OS X (e.g. clipboard in vim inside tmux)
* [Bashmarks](https://github.com/huyng/bashmarks) to bookmark directories in bash
